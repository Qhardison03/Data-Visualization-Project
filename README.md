# Data-Visualization-Project

This project is designed to showcase my skills in information visualization using real data and applications. 

# Getting Started
  ## Dataset | Applications Used:
   - http://jse.amstat.org/datasets/airport.dat.txt | http://jse.amstat.org/jse_data_archive.htm
   - Microsoft Excel
   - Tableau

I chose a dataset that involved various United States airport statistics. The dataset included all of the active airports in each major city, however, to condense the data, I grouped together all of the airport data from the same city to create the total sum of the following data variables: 

  - City
  - Total Amount of Scheduled Departures
  - Total Amount of Departures Performed
  - Total Amount of Passengers
  - Total Amount of Cargo Moved (in tons)

# Significance of my Data-Visualization-Project
 - Explained in detail and included in my Value of Visualization Report
 - Explained in detail and included in my Information Visualization Report

  ## SUMMARY 
I created two verisons of information visualization with the United States major cities airport data. 

  **The first verision (with Microsoft Excel):** 
   - Okay data-to-ink ratio
   - Colors make it simple to differentiate between the meaning of the lines
   - Begans to provide an unclear image with all the lines being close to each other
     
       Ex: Lines for the variables of the cities: Houston, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles interwine and gets unclear. Trends in the variables are unclear as well due to the unclear image.

  **Improvements of second verison (with Tableau):** 
  - Image shows variables set by multiple measurements, grouped and separated on the left by the city.
  - Includes the use of color and glyphs to separate the variables:
      - Blue Person with suitcase --> Repreesents the Total Amount of Passengers 
      - Red Calendar with time clock --> Represents the Total Amount of Scheduled Departures 
      - Green Plane taking off, with arrow pointing up --> Represents the Total Amount of Performed Departures
      - Brown Package box --> Represents the Total Amount of Cargo Moved (in tons)
